# 🛒 E-Commerce Web Application (Next.js)

## 📌 What I Built
I built a *simple e-commerce web application** using **Next.js (App Router)** that demonstrates the complete flow of an online shopping platform.  
The application includes product browsing, product details, cart management, order placement, and an admin panel to view orders and add products.

This project is created as part of an assignment to showcase **problem understanding, logical thinking, clean code structure, and task completion.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 👤 User Side
- Users can view a list of products on the home page.
- Each product has a dedicated product detail page.
- Users can add products to the cart.
- Cart page displays added products with the option to remove items.
- Users can place an order.
- After placing an order, users are redirected to an **Order Success** page.

### 🛠️ Admin Side
- Admin can add new products using the **Add Product** page.
- Admin can view all placed orders on the **Orders** page.
- Admin functionality is implemented in a **dummy/mock manner** without authentication, as required by the assignment.

## 🧰 Tech Stack Used
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **Context API** (for Cart and Orders state management)
- **CSS / Tailwind CSS (basic styling)**
- **Vercel** (Deployment)

---

## 📐 Assumptions Made
- This is a **frontend-focused assignment**, so no real backend or database is used.
- Cart and orders are stored using frontend state (Context API).
- Authentication and role-based access are not implemented.
- Data resets on page refresh, which is acceptable for this assignment.
- The focus is on **clear logic and working flow**, not production-level features.
